As a developer, I am excited to announce the launch of my latest project - Peek-a-view! 🚀 It is a cross-platform desktop application built using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Peek-a-view leverages the power of React.js for designing the user interface and managing the state of the application. 💻

## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Peek-a-view is built on top of Electron.js, making it a native desktop application compatible with multiple platforms, including Windows, Mac, Android, and Linux. This ensures that users can access the application seamlessly regardless of their preferred operating system. 🌎

- **Real-Time Communication**: Peek-a-view enables real-time data transmission between the client and server using the Web Socket Protocol and Socket.io library. This allows for smooth and uninterrupted communication, providing an enhanced user experience.

- **Screen Capture**: The application utilizes the Screenshot-desktop Node.js module for capturing screen images. This feature enables users to easily share their screen content with others, making collaboration and communication more efficient. 📸

- **Server-Side Development**: Peek-a-view's server-side is built using Express, a popular Node.js web framework. The CORS module is utilized to enable cross-origin resource sharing, while the UUID module generates unique IDs for each session, ensuring secure and personalized user experiences. 🔑
